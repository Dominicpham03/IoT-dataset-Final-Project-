# IoT-dataset-Final-Project-


For my CPE project, I chose to work with the ACI IoT Network Traffic Dataset 2023. I selected this dataset because it offers a realistic collection of over 1.2 million network flow records across 85 detailed features, capturing the complexity of real-world IoT environments. I was looking for a dataset that would provide a meaningful application for building classification and anomaly detection models, and this one perfectly fits that goal.
